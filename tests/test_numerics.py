"""Numerical locks on the statistics this project publishes.

WHY THESE ARE SEPARATE FROM THE BEHAVIOURAL SUITE. Every other test here
asks whether a function returns the value the design intends. These ask
whether that value is a real number of the kind it claims to be -- a
correlation inside [-1, 1], a variance that is the estimator its
docstring names. Those are different questions, and the second one is
invisible to the first: a correlation of 1.0000000000000002 satisfies
every assertion anyone would think to write about a perfect correlation,
and then raises ValueError inside the caller's `acos`.

WHAT THIS FOUND. `correlation` returned |rho| > 1 in 15.4% of random
two-point draws -- and n = 2 is the replicate pair the module was
written to recover, so the one sample size affected was its own case.
Not found by reading the formula, which is the textbook two-pass form
and is correct; found by running it 200,000 times and looking at the
range of the output.

MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. The counts below are exact for their seeds. A
test that asserted "clamping happens" by reading the source would test
spelling; these drive the function over the inputs where the defect
actually lives.
