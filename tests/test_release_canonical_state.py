"""Locks on the `canonical-state` distribution and its refusals.

Every refusal is driven over BOTH answers. A refusal only ever observed
refusing has not been shown to distinguish anything -- it could be
raising unconditionally -- so each one here is also given the input it
must accept.

Two of these exist because of defects found while building the deriver,
and both are recorded in the code they lock:

  * a page naming a file that does not ship (the renderer resolves
    `three` through an importmap pointing into `vendor/`), and

  * a packaging list that declares five top-level names while the tree
    contains twelve packages. `pip install .` then emitted `core/` and
    `backends/` holding nothing but `__init__.py`. The derived suite
    passed the whole time, because it runs inside the emitted directory
    and imports the source tree -- never an installed copy.
