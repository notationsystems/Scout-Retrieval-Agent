"""Probe the `canonical-state` deriver's refusals.

A build script whose checks cannot fire ships whatever it finds, and the
failure surfaces on a stranger's first `pip install`. Each mutation below
disables one refusal; the named test must notice.

Two of these disable checks that exist because the defect was real:
the asset check (a page naming a file that does not ship) and the
packaging-coverage check (a declaration that omits half the tree, which
the derived suite could not see because it imports the source).
